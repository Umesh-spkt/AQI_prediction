			Air pollution is considered to be one of the biggest environmental threats. Air Quality Prediction System
			has sole purpose of providing insights about daily air quality. We have used Machine learning  approach  to
			predict ambient air quality with the help of air quality data. We have obtained ground data sets from Department
			of Hydrology and Meteorology which were used in Prediction of Air Quality Index.

	   <p>
			Our<a href="{% url 'main:predict' %}"> Predict AQI </a> page can successfully  predict Air Quality Index of Kathmandu
		   City with reasonable accuracy. Particulate matters in air is our primary feature to predict the air quality.
		   We have used PM 10, PM 2.5, O3 to predict Air Quality Index. The predicted AQI value can be compared against
		   the category table below to Know quality of air. One can access the past data of respective parameters from
		   our <a href="{% url 'main:past-data' %}"> Past data</a> page to study trend of air pollution level
	  in previous years.
